        <p>Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites. In 1995, the "Online Diary" on the
            Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available. Posts were
            made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text-based HTML code using FTP software
            in real time several times a day. To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained
            multiple new entries per day. At the beginning of each new day, new diary entries were manually coded into a
            new HTML file, and at the start of each month, diary entries were archived into their own folder which
            contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month. Then menus that contained links to the most
            recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site. This text-based method of organizing thousands
            of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software
            developed years later</p>
        <p>The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual, rather than a
            corporation or organization. While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers, other than
            the blogger's immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs have become popular, to the
            point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship. A tiny number of personal bloggers have
            become famous, both in the online community and in the real world.</p>
        <p>A blog can be private, as in most cases, or it can be for business or not-for-profit organization or
            government purposes. Blogs used internally, and only available to employees via an Intranet are called
            corporate blogs. Companies use internal corporate blogs enhance the communication, culture and employee
            engagement in a corporation. Internal corporate blogs can be used to communicate news about company policies
            or procedures, build employee esprit de corps and improve morale. Companies and other organizations also use
            external, publicly accessible blogs for marketing, branding, or public relations purposes. Some
            organizations have a blog authored by their executive; in practice, many of these executive blog posts are
            penned by a ghostwriter, who makes posts in the style of the credited author. Similar blogs for clubs and
            societies are called club blogs, group blogs, or by similar names; typical use is to inform members and
            other interested parties of club and member activities.</p>
        <p>Microblogging is the practice of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures,
            links, short videos, or other media—on the Internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that
            feels organic and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, in part because the
            short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting. Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates
            use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their
            publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. A wide and growing
            range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. The resulting
            profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication.</p>
